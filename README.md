# README

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`_Pands.ipynb`) designed to demonstrate essential pandas and NumPy operations for data analysis and manipulation. The notebook includes practical examples, such as creating DataFrames, reading data from Excel files, and performing basic data transformations.

## Notebook Highlights

The notebook covers:

1. **Creating DataFrames**:
   - Using dictionaries to initialize pandas DataFrames.
   - Handling columns with diverse data types like strings, integers, and dates.

2. **Data Import**:
   - Reading Excel files using pandas for seamless data integration.

3. **NumPy Integration**:
   - Applying NumPy functions for numerical computations within pandas workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- pandas
- numpy

Install the required libraries using:

pip install pandas numpy


## How to Use

## Example Content

### DataFrame Creation Example
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data dictionary
Dict={
    "Name":["Ella Khan", "Lilly" ,"Milli","Alisha","Danish"],
    "City":["Arizona","Etovok","Menchester","Delhi","Islamabad"],
    "Marks":[880,990,789,560,1000],
    "DoB":["2006","2005","2006","2005","2006"],
    "Contact":["03434567432","03434567430","03430567432","03034567432","03422567332"]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(Dict)
```

### Excel File Reading
```python
# Reading data from an Excel file
file_path = "data.xlsx"
data = pd.read_excel(file_path)
```

## Purpose

This notebook serves as an educational resource for:
- Beginners learning pandas and NumPy.
